The Ticket Booking System is a comprehensive, web-based event management application developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). The system provides a complete solution for managing events, ticket bookings, customers, organizers, and venues through an intuitive Bengali-language user interface designed for local users in Bangladesh.

The application includes a secure authentication system with user registration, login, session management, and a pre-configured admin account. It features an interactive dashboard displaying real-time statistics such as total events, tickets, customers, and booking status, along with dynamic data visualizations powered by Chart.js.

All core entities support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and data is persistently stored using the browser’s LocalStorage API, eliminating the need for a backend server. The system follows object-oriented design principles, modern UI/UX practices, and responsive layouts to ensure a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.

This project demonstrates practical skills in frontend web development, data management, responsive design, and third-party library integration, and serves as a strong foundation for future expansion into a full-stack ticket booking platform.
